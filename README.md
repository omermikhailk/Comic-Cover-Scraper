# ComicScraper
A Python program which downloads the comic cover(s) for a given comic
title that you provide.

# Requirements
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- Python 3 (version 3.6+)
- `lxml`
- `requests`

To get all of these dependancies you can run `pip -r requirements.txt`
which will download all of the necessary packages for you.

# Notes
This program is a WIP and doesn't have a lot of functionality as of yet.
It only supports downloading the covers for DC comic books and
doesn't have support for the user entering their own comic titles, yet also.
